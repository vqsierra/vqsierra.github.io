    "text": "Teaching\n\n\n\n\nTeaching\n\n\nMy teaching philosophy is deeply committed to dismantling colonialism within educational settings. This mission extends beyond recognizing the impacts of colonialism on students’ learning; it involves actively challenging the pervasive processes of alienation that students often encounter in their educational journeys. In a variety of instructional settings, I incorporate the principles of Red Pedagogy to create more inclusive and equitable learning environments for all learners. Red Pedagogy is a critical pedagogical framework developed by Quechua scholar Sandy Grande, that seeks to decolonize education by centering Indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing. This approach provides a pathway to confront the prevailing Western-centric educational paradigm, while also promoting social justice, anti-colonialist and anti-racist learning.\n\n\nI possess a mastery in delivering instruction across diverse settings—ranging from formal university classrooms and community workshops to online platforms. My instructional abilities span a broad spectrum of disciplines, including Social Work, Ethnic Studies, and Psychology. In community settings, I have facilitated health promotion education, cultural workshops, and teach-ins. Within the academic realm, my roles have encompassed positions such as Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) and Associate Instructor. I have been awarded two university-level distinctions for my innovative teaching approach and ability to promote student learning: the Outstanding GSI Award in 2022, and the Teaching Effectiveness Award in 2023.\n\n\nTo learn more about my teaching approach, please review my essay titled “Towards a Red Pedagogy for Social Work Education” as part of the Teaching Effectiveness Award at https://gsi.berkeley.edu/sierra-2023/.
