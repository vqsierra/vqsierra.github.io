Ground noise filtering -- that is, excluding \nreturns from LiDAR point clouds based on simple height thresholds -- is a \ncommon practice meant to improve the 'signal' content of LiDAR returns by \npreventing ground returns from masking useful information about tree size and \ncondition contained within canopy returns. Although this procedure originated \nin LiDAR-based estimation of mean tree and canopy height, ground noise \nfiltering has remained prevalent in LiDAR pre-processing, even as modelers \nhave shifted focus to forest aboveground biomass (AGB) and related \ncharacteristics for which ground returns may actually contain useful \ninformation about stand density and openness. In particular, ground returns \nmay be helpful for making accurate biomass predictions in heterogeneous \nlandscapes that include a patchy mosaic of vegetation heights and land cover \ntypes. \n\nIn this paper, we applied several ground noise filtering thresholds while \nmapping two study areas in New York (USA), one a forest-dominated area and the \nother a mixed-use landscape. We observed that removing ground noise via any \nheight threshold systematically biases many of the LiDAR-derived variables \nused in AGB modeling. By fitting random forest models to each of these \npredictor sets, we found that that ground noise filtering yields models of \nforest AGB with lower accuracy than models trained using predictors derived \nfrom unfiltered point clouds. The relative inferiority of AGB models based on \nfiltered LiDAR returns was much greater for the mixed land-cover study area \nthan for the contiguously forested study area. Our results suggest that ground \nfiltering should be avoided when mapping biomass, particularly when mapping \nheterogeneous and highly patchy landscapes, as ground returns are more likely \nto represent useful 'signal' than extraneous 'noise' in these cases. \n\n<br />\n\n![](dists.svg)\n\nFigure 1: Distributions of common LiDAR-derived metrics (including density percentiles, decile heights, L-moments, and quadratic mean height) for the pooled dataset at various levels of ground noise filtering.
