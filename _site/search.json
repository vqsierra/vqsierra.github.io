    "title": "Filtering ground noise from LiDAR returns produces inferior models of forest aboveground biomass",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Read the paper!\n\n\nSee the poster!\n\nAirborne LiDAR has become an essential data source for large-scale, high-resolution modeling of forest biomass and carbon stocks, enabling predictions with much higher resolution and accuracy than can be achieved using optical imagery alone. Ground noise filtering – that is, excluding returns from LiDAR point clouds based on simple height thresholds – is a common practice meant to improve the ‘signal’ content of LiDAR returns by preventing ground returns from masking useful information about tree size and condition contained within canopy returns. Although this procedure originated in LiDAR-based estimation of mean tree and canopy height, ground noise filtering has remained prevalent in LiDAR pre-processing, even as modelers have shifted focus to forest aboveground biomass (AGB) and related characteristics for which ground returns may actually contain useful information about stand density and openness. In particular, ground returns may be helpful for making accurate biomass predictions in heterogeneous landscapes that include a patchy mosaic of vegetation heights and land cover types.\nIn this paper, we applied several ground noise filtering thresholds while mapping two study areas in New York (USA), one a forest-dominated area and the other a mixed-use landscape. We observed that removing ground noise via any height threshold systematically biases many of the LiDAR-derived variables used in AGB modeling. By fitting random forest models to each of these predictor sets, we found that that ground noise filtering yields models of forest AGB with lower accuracy than models trained using predictors derived from unfiltered point clouds. The relative inferiority of AGB models based on filtered LiDAR returns was much greater for the mixed land-cover study area than for the contiguously forested study area. Our results suggest that ground filtering should be avoided when mapping biomass, particularly when mapping heterogeneous and highly patchy landscapes, as ground returns are more likely to represent useful ‘signal’ than extraneous ‘noise’ in these cases.\n\n\nFigure 1: Distributions of common LiDAR-derived metrics (including density percentiles, decile heights, L-moments, and quadratic mean height) for the pooled dataset at various levels of ground noise filtering. Filtering reduces the variance in many metrics, reducing the total amount of information available to models.\n\n\nFigure 2: Height threshold-based filtering of LiDAR returns produces inferior models across all landscape types, with more notable impacts in mixed-use landscapes"

This mission extends beyond recognizing the impacts of colonialism on students’ learning; it involves actively challenging the pervasive processes of alienation that students often interface with in their educational journeys. In a variety of instructional settings, I incorporate the principles of Red Pedagogy to create more inclusive and equitable learning environments for all learners. Red Pedagogy is a critical pedagogical framework developed by Quechua scholar Sandy Grande, that seeks to decolonize education by centering Indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing. This approach provides a pathway to the prevailing Western-centric educational paradigm, but also promote social justice, anti-colonialist and anti-racist learning.\n\n\nI posses a mastery in delivering instruction across diverse settings—ranging from formal university classrooms and community workshops to online platforms. My instructional abilities span a broad spectrum of disciplines, including Social Work, Ethnic Studies, and Psychology. In community settings, I have facilitated health promotion education, cultural activities, and teach-ins. Within the academic realm, my roles have encompassed positions such as Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) and Associate Instructor. I have been awarded two separate university-level distinctions for my innovate teaching approach and ability promote student learning. These include the Outstanding GSI Award in 2022, and the Teaching Effectiveness Award in 2023.\n\n\nTo learn more about my teaching approach, please review my essay titled “Towards a Red Pedagogy for Social Work Education” as part of the Teaching Effectiveness Award at https://gsi.berkeley.edu/sierra-2023/.
